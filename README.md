# Business Analytics Enhanced with Machine Learning
Business analytics are techniques that enterprises use to gain insights from their data and make better decisions.

I employ quantitative tools and sophisticated software, such as Python, to analyze the data. I have tried using different models, including linear regression, clustering, and k-means, to find the best solution for analyzing the data.

Many firms across a variety of industries use these techniques, including Google, Amazon, Target, Coca-Cola, and Walmart. These techniques are applicable to many functional areas of business, such as operations, marketing, accounting, and finance. Furthermore, the modern abundance of data, often referred to as “Big Data,” underscores the value that analytics can provide to a firm, whether it is non-profit, for-profit, or government.
